# Setup:
## Docker and PostgreSQL:
If you don't have it installed already, you'll need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

Be sure to follow the [post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) steps too.

Copy the example.env, change the password to be a sensible password.

Then we `docker compose up` in here, and the compose file does some magic.

Then we create a database! YIPPEE :D



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
